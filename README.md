## Date: 16 October 2023
## Aim : Inheritance
## Algorithm: 

Algorithm for Constructor Calling in Inheritance:
The base class constructor is called first.
The derived class constructor is called after the base class constructor.
The constructors are called in the order of inheritance, meaning the base class constructor is called before the derived class constructor.
